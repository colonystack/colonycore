// Package plugins hosts plugin implementation subpackages. It intentionally
// contains no production runtime code itself; this file exists to satisfy
// tooling (import-boss, go vet) for the architectural guard tests that live
// alongside it.
//
// A NOTE ON testhelper:
//
//	The subpackage plugins/testhelper is a deliberate escape hatch used only
//	in tests to construct facade fixtures from internal domain entities. It is
//	excluded from the architecture test that forbids importing colonycore/pkg/domain
//	so that real plugin packages (e.g. plugins/frog) remain fully decoupled
//	from internal domain shapes. Do not import testhelper in production plugin
//	code; its presence is solely to aid unit tests and may change without
//	stability guarantees.
