# RFC: ColonyCore Base Module

- Status: Draft — v0.3.0 baseline includes Facility/Treatment/Observation/Sample/Permit/SupplyItem flows; plugin upgrade guidance in docs/plugins/upgrade-notes.md; references ADR-0007 storage baseline, ADR-0008 object storage contract, ADR-0009 plugin interface stability & semver policy, ADR-0010 contextual accessor pattern implementation
- Created: 2025-09-21
- Authors: Tobias Harnickell
- Stakeholders: Tobias Harnickell
- Target Release: v0.1.0

## 1. Purpose & Scope
- Track organisms and cohorts from planning through end-of-life with auditable housing, lineage, health, procedural, and inventory histories.
- Provide a stable, species-agnostic domain model plus plugin extension points for species packages (frog, rat, ant, etc.) without hard-coding species logic.
- Enable compliant colony operations aligned with EU Directive 2010/63, IACUC analogs, and local permit regimes while remaining policy-neutral.

### 1.1 Non-Goals
- We will not implement facility-specific SOPs or husbandry policies beyond configurable rules.
- We will not replace downstream ELN/LIMS systems. Instead, we provide integration points.
- We will not deliver a production-grade UI. This RFC focuses on the backend domain, APIs, and plugin contracts.

## 2. Success Metrics
- Onboard a new species module (from template) in under 10 engineer-days with zero core code changes.
- 99.5% of core workflows (breeding, housing moves, procedure logging) executable via API with auditable history checks.
- Detect and block 95% of rule violations (housing capacity, protocol limits, restricted pairings) at transaction time with explainable feedback.
- Maintain sub-1s median response time on read-heavy endpoints for installations with 25k active organisms and 1M historical events.
- Achieve 100% trace coverage for compliance-sensitive actions (create/update/remove) linked to user identity and protocol context.

## 5. Lifecycle & State Machines
### 5.1 Organism Lifecycle
States: `planned → embryo/larva → juvenile → adult → retired → deceased`. Transitions enforce:
- Species module may refine stage mapping while preserving canonical states.
- Automatic stage updates triggered by age thresholds, procedures, or manual overrides with justification.
- Terminal `deceased` state requires cause-of-death, disposal method, and audit trail.

### 5.2 Housing Lifecycle
States: `quarantine`, `active`, `cleaning`, `decommissioned`. Rules:
- Entry to `quarantine` requires assigned protocol and biosecurity clearance.
- `active` enforces capacity and compatibility via species module hooks.
- Transition to `cleaning` requires occupants relocated or tagged for sanitation.
- `decommissioned` prevents future assignments.

### 5.3 Compliance Lifecycle
States: `draft → submitted → approved → on-hold → expired → archived`.
- Approval gating integrates with electronic signatures and timestamping.
- `on-hold` suspends dependent actions. Resumption requires recorded justification.

### 5.4 Procedure Lifecycle
States: `scheduled → in-progress → completed` with optional `cancelled`.
- Scheduling validates resource availability, protocol coverage, and species-specific prerequisites.
- Completion writes immutable outcome records and triggers follow-up tasks (treatments, observations).

## 6. Plugin Architecture & Extension Contracts
### 6.1 Capability Interfaces
| Interface | Responsibility | Contextual Access Pattern |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LifecycleRules` | Map age, time, and metrics to the canonical lifecycle states and expose transition validation. | `organism.GetCurrentStage().IsActive()`, `stageCtx.Adult().IsActive()` |
| `BreedingPlanner` | Recommend pairings, detect kinship conflicts, and project timelines. | `organism.IsActive() && !organism.IsRetired()` |
| `PhenotypeSchema` | Provide JSON Schema fragments for species-specific observation fields. | `organism.Attributes()` with contextual validation |
| `GenotypingRules` | Validate marker sets, allele plausibility, and inheritance warnings. | Organism lineage with contextual stage checking |
| `HusbandrySchedule` | Emit task templates (feeding, tank changes) with recurrence rules. | `housing.GetEnvironmentType().IsAquatic()`, `housing.SupportsSpecies("frog")` |
| `BodyMetrics` | Define measurement units, normal ranges, and conversion logic. | Stage-specific calculations via `GetCurrentStage()` |
| `EnvironmentalNeeds` | Specify acceptable ranges for temperature, humidity, pH, etc. | `housingCtx.Aquatic().IsHumid()`, contextual environment matching |
| `EuthanasiaMethods` | Enumerate allowable methods with compliance references. | `protocol.IsActiveProtocol()`, contextual compliance checking |
| `AgeStageMapper` | Convert chronological age and morphometrics to stage labels. | `stageCtx.Juvenile().String()` for stage mapping |
| `ComplianceChecks` | Add species-specific hard/soft validation hooks for workflows. | `protocol.CanAcceptNewSubjects()`, contextual capacity checks |

**Contextual Accessor Enforcement**: All plugin interfaces must use the contextual accessor pattern (ADR-0010) instead of raw constant access. This includes:
- Environment checking via `housing.GetEnvironmentType()` methods
- Lifecycle stage queries via `organism.GetCurrentStage()` methods  
- Protocol status validation via `protocol.GetCurrentStatus()` methods
- Entity and action references via context providers (e.g., `NewEntityContext().Organism()`)
- Provider interfaces for formats and dialects (e.g., `GetFormatProvider().JSON()`)

### 6.2 Data Extension Points
- Species modules register JSON Schema fragments to extend Organism, Procedure, Observation, and Sample payloads. Each fragment is versioned and traceable.
- Derived attribute calculators run post-transaction to compute metrics (e.g., condition scores) and persist to materialized views.
- Validation hooks execute within database transactions to block invalid state changes and emit structured errors.

### 6.3 UI/API Composition
- Core API publishes an OpenAPI specification with extension slots, and species modules contribute additional paths and definitions through manifests.
- Declarative UI descriptors (JSON) describe form fields, ordering, validation messaging, and context-specific visibility.
- Reporting layer loads plugin-provided templates (SQL/DSL) with parameter metadata for dashboards and exports.

### 6.4 Rules Engine Hooks
- Policy DSL allows species modules to express constraints (age, kinship, housing compatibility) evaluated pre-commit.
- Rule evaluations produce explainable outcomes (pass/block/warn) with remediation hints and trace IDs.
- Conflict detection framework flags overlapping policies and surfaces to operators for resolution.

## 7. Data & Integration Standards
- Storage Baseline: See ADR-0007. For v0.1.0 an embedded SQLite snapshot store provides durability; a Postgres backend will be introduced for higher concurrency.
- Core schema (future normalized target) will use relational tables with foreign keys and temporal history; interim snapshot persistence uses JSON buckets in SQLite (ADR-0007). Species fields are stored in JSON-like structures with schema references.
- Identifiers: UUID primary keys, optional local accessions, barcode/RFID/QR attachments with immutable binding history.
- External references: NCBI Taxonomy IDs, OBO phenotypic/assay terms, ISO 8601 timestamps, SI units with metadata.
- Integrations include hardware ingestion (barcode/RFID scanners, scales, environmental sensors) via driver abstraction or MQTT/HTTP bridges.
- Authentication relies on SSO (OIDC or SAML), and RBAC enforces least-privilege roles, per-project data scoping, and audit logs that capture actor, timestamp, and context.

## 8. Compliance & Governance Constraints
- Protocol and permit linkage required before executing regulated procedures or exceeding species/strain counts.
- Severity classifications are stored per organism and procedure, and humane endpoints are enforced through blocking rules with override logging.
- Tamper-evident audit trails use digital signatures for critical events, and retention policies remain configurable for each jurisdiction.
- Privacy controls support pseudonymization, minimal data capture, consent linkage, and access review workflows.
- Semantic versioning is enforced across the core platform and species plugins, with migration guides, feature flags, and deprecation policy documented for every release.

## 9. Observability, Quality, and Performance
- Maintain structured logs with correlation IDs for multi-step workflows, and track metrics for queue lag, rule evaluation latency, and occupancy utilization.
- Tracing spans cover external hardware integrations and long-running procedures.
- Monitor data quality to detect orphaned entities, inconsistent states, and overdue sanitation, and run nightly integrity checks that produce actionable reports.
- Testing strategy: deterministic fixtures for species plugins, contract tests for API extensions, migration tests with sample datasets, fuzzers for rules engine.
- Performance targets: asynchronous workers for heavy computations (pedigree analysis, report generation), sub-second reads for common queries.

## 10. Acceptance Criteria
- Core schema implements entities and relationships listed in Section 4 with migration scripts and temporal history.
- CRUD APIs and audit logging provided for Organism, Cohort, HousingUnit, BreedingUnit, Procedure, Protocol, and Project entities.
- Rules engine executes species and compliance hooks in-transaction with configurable severity levels (block/warn/log).
- Plugin SDK exposes capability interfaces, JSON Schema extension registration, and test harness with seed fixtures.
- Compliance workflows enforce protocol/permit checks before breeding, procedures, or inventory actions, with override logging.
- The observability stack emits the structured logs, metrics, and traces described above and runs scheduled integrity check jobs.
- Documentation delivered for plugin authors and integration partners.

## 11. Reference Species Module: Frog (Minimal)
### 11.1 Purpose
Provide a working module that exercises every plugin interface, validates template assumptions, and demonstrates species customization without core changes.

### 11.2 Capability Implementations
- `LifecycleRules`: Maps developmental stages using Gosner stages grouped to the canonical lifecycle states and enforces completion of metamorphosis before adult classification.
- `BreedingPlanner`: Supports pair and harem configurations, enforces water quality thresholds before spawning, and blocks pairings closer than second-degree kinship.
- `PhenotypeSchema`: Adds fields for skin coloration index, voice call frequency, and limb regeneration observations.
- `GenotypingRules`: Defines microsatellite markers with inheritance plausibility checks and cross contamination warnings.
- `HusbandrySchedule`: Generates feeding (live insects) and water change tasks with temperature dependencies.
- `BodyMetrics`: Declares default units (grams, millimeters), calculates body condition based on snout–vent length ratio.
- `EnvironmentalNeeds`: Specifies acceptable water temperature (18–24°C), pH (6.5–7.5), humidity (>70%), and light cycle.
- `EuthanasiaMethods`: Lists MS-222 immersion and double pithing with references to AVMA guidelines.
- `AgeStageMapper`: Converts days post-fertilization and morphological markers to stage labels for reporting.
- `ComplianceChecks`: Validates that metamorphs in quarantine cannot be released to common rooms without negative pathogen tests.

### 11.3 Data Extensions
- Organism schema adds fields: `developmental_stage`, `water_source`, `disease_screening_status`.
- Observation schema adds enumerations for `skin_score` and numeric `call_frequency_hz`.
- Sample schema adds `tissue_type` with frog-specific options (e.g., toe clip, skin swab).

## 14. Outstanding Questions
- Should plugin schemas support backward incompatible changes via version negotiation or require parallel versions?
- What minimum hardware certification is acceptable for sensor integrations to participate in compliance-critical workflows?
- Do we need automated detection of offline export retention breaches or rely on manual attestations (see Annex-0001 §3.3)?

## 15. Milestones
